There is a matching [Syntax theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax), but most other Syntax themes work fine as well.

### Install

This theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to the __Settings > Themes__ section and selecting "One Dark" from the __UI Themes__ drop-down menu.

### FAQ

__Why do the colors change when I switch Syntax themes.__
This UI theme uses the same background color as the choosen Syntax theme. In case that Syntax theme has a light background color, it only uses its hue, but otherwise stays dark. This lets you use dark-light combos.
